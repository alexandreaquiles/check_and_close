You can easily close the current tab, close all the other tabs, close those to the rigth and those opened by the current tab. But, isn't something missing? What if you want to close some and leave some alone?

"Check and Close" is a Google Chrome extension that displays all the tabs on the current window as checkboxes, so that you can choose which to close.

Close only the tabs you want and continue your happy browsing!
